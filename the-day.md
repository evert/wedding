===============

The big day is August 13th! We will be welcoming our closest friends and
people that traveled from from abroad at around 2pm ck to attend
our ceremony.

Everyone else is welcome to join the reception, which starts at 5pm.

For the people that live or stay in Groningen, we will providing a shuttle
service, so you don't have to think about transportation or how many
beverages you've had.

It might get a little chilly in the evening, so bringing a blanket might be
a good idea. The average temperatures for the area can be found
