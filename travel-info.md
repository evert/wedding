Stay
----

Nijega is very tiny, and doesn't have hotels. So we suggest staying in the
nearby [Groningen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groningen), a young vibrant
city guaranteed to give you a true Dutch experience! We will also plan some
activities in the days leading up to the wedding. Keep in mind to search for
something closer to the city centre, locally referred to as Binnenstad.
