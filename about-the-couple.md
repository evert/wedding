About the Couple
================

Roxy first noticed Evert on a dating site called Plenty of Fish. Although she was not usually one to make the first move, there was something special about Evert so decided to reach out to him. Et voila! They met at Cafe Diplomatico located in the Little Italy neighbourhood of downtown Toronto. It was a cold Wednesday evening, December 10, 2008, to be exact! One pint turned into one pitcher and the rest is history. Less than a year later Evert accompanied Roxy to Korea where she took a job teaching English. Sadly the couple decided to go their separate ways so Roxy could travel and Evert could go back to Europe to focus on work. Throughout the break, the love never faded and the bond grew stronger. Three years later, Evert decided enough was enough and took the plunge to move back to Canada to be with Roxy! Friends and family were not surprised! One night during an evening stroll over the famous Cable Bridge in Budapest, Hungary, Evert got down on one knee! Again, friends and family were not surprised! The couple live in a nice townhome in downtown Toronto with Evertâ€™s extended Nintendo collection and their kitten, Pigeon.
